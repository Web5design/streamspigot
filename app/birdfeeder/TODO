todo:
- add timestamps to birdpinger
- cache user data so that feed fetches involve no twitter RPCs
- reduce update cron job frequency
- reply and retweet links
- "scavenger" to delete old tweets from StatusData?
- remove URLs (especially if at end?) from title snippet
- @mentions feed
- prune null values and useless keys (e.g. profile_background_image_url_https) from persisted statuses
- generalize twitter exception wrapping
- better 404 handler
- record screencast showing realtime flow

thumbnail URLs to support:
- 4sq.com
- pic.twitter.com (when manually inserted into tweets, it doesn't show up as a media entity - http://twitter.com/redrockcoffee/status/157687607613071360)
- mlkshk.com (from http://twitter.com/chockenberry/status/165479284985696256)
- picplz.com (from http://twitter.com/whizziwig/status/164044099777863681)
- picasaweb (from http://twitter.com/ohunt/status/164507898037284864)

done:

- i.imgur.com
- why does /tweet-digest/digest?usernames=pogue&output=atom take 65ms (only 8ms in RPCs)
- make twitter API cache interface more efficient (right now it does two RPCs for cache hits, one to get the timestamp, one for the data)

- "authenticate" birdpinger by requiring a secret token in all requests
- remove 60 second cache from Bird Feeder API instances

- drop status ID/timestamps older than 24 hours from StreamData
- in birdpinger, filter out tweets that are in_reply_to_user_id for users that we don't care about (e.g. https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/show.json?id=160246443020517376&include_entities=true)
- catch exceptions when fetching timeline tweets
- don't enable ereporter in dev mode
