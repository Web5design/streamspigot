    <p>This <a href="/">{{ APP_NAME|escape }}</a> tool lets you read blogs (or
    anything else with an RSS or Atom feed) that you've come across from the
    start. This works well with blogs with big archives, as well as
    <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/">topical</a>
    <a href="http://calendar.perfplanet.com/">"Advent"</a> 
    <a href="http://perladvent.pm.org/FAQ-2shortplanks.html">blogs</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Simply enter the URL of the blog or feed that you wish to play back,
    and (optionally) pick a start date and update frequency if you don't want to
    read it from the beginning. Once the playback is setup, you'll get an Atom
    feed URL that you can subscribe to.

  <p>The tool uses Google Reader's feed archive to get data, which means that
  if a blog predates Google Reader (which launched in October 2005) it may
  be missing posts.</p>
  
  <p>The Atom feed that is generated is a Google Reader tag feed. This means
  that Reader metadata about the original post (who shared or liked it,
  published and crawl date, etc.) is preserved, and content is not duplicated.
  However, you do not have to use Google Reader to subscribe to it, any consumer
  of Atom 1.0 should work just as well.</p>
